        This is also in an email I sent to you and your mom and dad. What a
        great lesson today! I was so excited to see the progress you&apos;ve
        been making on the first three chords. It&apos;s tough, but you&apos;re
        really getting there. Maybe strong hands from all that metal work helps!

      <h2 class="mt-4 text-1.5xl font-bold">To Do</h2>

      <ul class="list-disc m-4">
        <li>
          I don&apos;t know if you accepted the invitation to collaborate on the
          playlist so here&apos;s a new link. Keep an ear open for songs to
          share! The new chords and the C major scale are on the Jamboard.
        </li>
        <li><span class="line-through">Access the Jamboard</span></li>
        <li>
          Keep playing the D, A7, and G chords, and try out the Am, Em, and Dm
          chords. Or just one or two of them! I&apos;ve given you a lot because
          you&apos;re showing me that you can put in the work, but it&apos;s
          okay to slow down if it&apos;s too much!
        </li>
        <li>Practice the D major pattern and the C major scale.</li>
        <li>BONUS: Find a friend and show them a chord!</li>
      </ul>
