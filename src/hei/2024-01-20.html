          Work on the D and A7 chords and the D major pattern for next week. Don&apos;t
          worry about the G chord for now.

          Remember, 10 minutes of practice each day is so much better than an hour
          next Friday.

          Try to bring your guitar to Mockingbird music and get new strings and
          see if they can adjust the neck to make it easier to play. If you want
          we can change them during a lesson. It&apos;s okay if you don&apos;t get to this
          right away.

      <p class="mt-4">I added a version of Tom Dooley by Doc Watson to the playlist, he was a
      legendary folk and bluegrass musician, I saw him maybe 20 years ago when he
      was in his late 80s I think! So good.</p>

      <p class="mt-4">I also added a song from Spotify
      ROSALÍA radio, Me Duele. Sounds like something we could work towards
      playing. Is this the kind of music you are into? I guess the title means “It
      Hurts.” Kinda like learning chords when you&apos;re starting out! I promise it
      gets better.</p>
