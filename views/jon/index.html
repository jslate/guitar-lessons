          Parts of two

              The single best piece of advice I ever got on marriage is that
              there is no use in thinking of your partner as a single stable
              entity that exists separate from you. There’s only your partner in
              a dynamic with you. There’s only who you also bring out in your
              partner, that they’ll be somebody totally different with other
              people. But so the question always, if things are going right or
              wrong, is, like, which parts of the two of you are being brought
              out in relationship? Not just, who is this person and do I like
              them?

          Depressive Realism

              Depressive realism is a term that was coined by Lauren Alloy and
              Lyn Abramson in 1979. It refers to the idea that more depressed
              people have a more accurate perception of reality than
              non-depressed people. This idea has been challenged by subsequent
              research, as well as proponents of cognitive behavioral therapy,
              who aim to identify cognitive distortions in patients with
              depression.

              ...I sometimes think about mental illness in terms of porousness.
              There are some mental illnesses where one of the major problems is
              you’re too porous. You’re letting the world in, and it’s — you
              can’t resist it...
            </p>

            <p class="mt-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto text-lg">
              And then I think there are other illnesses where you’re so closed
              off from the world. You’re not letting the world in. I mean, I
              think resignation syndrome would be something like that. And it
              was almost like Naomi couldn’t calibrate her receptivity to all
              this injustice that she was reading about and that she was seeing.
              And she wanted more and more of it. Even that impulse to know more
              instead of to protect herself from it contributed to what happened
              to her.
